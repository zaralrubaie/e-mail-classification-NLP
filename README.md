# e-mail-classification-NLP
a model that classify weather the e-mail is a spam or not
This model aims to build a machine learning model that can classify SMS or email messages as Spam or Non-Spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 

The dataset contains two main columns:
Message_body: The raw text message.
Label: The classification label â€” 0 for Non-Spam and 1 for Spam.

reprocessing Steps:
To prepare the data for modeling, the following preprocessing steps were applied:
Lowercasing all text
Removing punctuation and special characters
Removing stopwords
Lemmatization (with SpaCy)
Removing messages with excessive weird/unreadable characters
TF-IDF vectorization with: max_features=5000,ngram_range=(1, 2),min_df=5, max_df=0.7

results:
Metric	Value
Best C (Regularization)	100
Best Cross-Validation Accuracy	0.964
Test Accuracy (Final Model)	0.864

Observation:
Cross-validation showed high accuracy (~96%), indicating good model generalization.
However, test set accuracy was slightly lower (~86% with tuned hyperparameter), possibly due to class imbalance or limited data.
Model struggles a bit with identifying non-spam (some false positives).

Future Improvements:
1-Handle class imbalance using SMOTE or undersampling
2-Try other models: Naive Bayes, SVM, XGBoost
3-Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
